# MetaCall FaaS

Reimplementation of MetaCall FaaS platform written in TypeScript. This project requires MetaCall installed in order to run it. For more information about installation: https://github.com/metacall/install

### Development

```sh
npm install
npm start
```

### About Project

MetaCall organization has its own cloud platform known as [MetaCall Hub](https://metacall.io/), a production-ready and high-performance FaaS/Cloud platform where you can deploy services, web apps, and lambdas in seconds. However, the `Real` version of MetaCall FaaS is commercialized and requires a plan to deploy your polyglot applications, which can be found [Here](https://metacall.io/pricing/).

When referring to the `Real` version of MetaCall FaaS, it should be noted that this refers to the commercialized FaaS cloud service, whereas `Local` refers to the mimic version.

Soon, we realized that many contributors joining the community needed an paid account on the `Real FaaS` for testing their polyglot applications. To remove this barrier, we proposed a project that would mimic the `Real FaaS`.

With this project, developers can now use it to deploy and test their polyglot applications (built using [MetaCall Core](https://github.com/metacall/core)), web apps, and lambdas. The process is simple:

-   Step 1 : Spin up the "Local FaaS" by running the following command:

```sh
cd faas
npm start
```

-   Step 2 : Install the [metacall-deploy](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@metacall/deploy) NPM package, and wire the `--dev` flag with the `metacall-deploy` command in your application directory using the following command:

```sh
cd move-to-application-directory
metacall-deploy --dev
```

### Things that need to be implemented

-   In order to mimic the "Real FaaS", we need to create all the API endpoints that the "Real FaaS" supports, which can be found listed [Here](https://github.com/metacall/protocol/blob/master/src/protocol.ts).

### Important Note

-   This project is still under development and there is one extra thing you need to install before running this project and its [MetaCall Core](https://github.com/metacall/core/blob/develop/docs/README.md#41-installation).

-   This project is developed using [MetaCall Core] itself in order to provide polyglot support, we are using its [Node Port](https://github.com/metacall/core/tree/develop/source/ports/node_port) of this library to use all the functions and methods `MetaCall Core C API` provides.

-   Also, [Here](https://github.com/metacall/faas/blob/master/types/metacall.d.ts) are all the functions of `MetaCall Core` we are using.
